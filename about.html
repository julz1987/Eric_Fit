            <h3>My Transformation Story</h3>
            <p>
                Growing up, I had severe body dysmorphia. I was convinced I was too skinny. Being uncomfortable in my own skin was the worst feeling and it brought a dark cloud to my daily life.             
            </p>
            <p>
                More than 10 years later, I am able to wear any clothes I desire, I feel comfortable around people and, most importantly, I’m able to go to the beach, which I deprived myself of for so long (yes, it was that serious). I can tell you from personal experience that investing in your health is the most crucial and rewarding project you can ever take on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the course of the past decade that it took me to transform my physique, I acquired tremendous knowledge about the human body: its anatomy, functions, and reactions to diet and supplementation. My passion is sharing my knowledge with other people in order to help them feel comfortable in their own skin and achieve the body of their dreams.
